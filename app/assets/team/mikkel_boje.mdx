fun_facts:
  work: I love everything-product from business models, user needs, and engineering frameworks to crisp user interfaces. I regard my colleagues as the most motivating part of my job.
  other: I love almost all types of sports and do some once in a while. This comes in handy for the calories balance as I also like to eat (not cook) nice food. I get inspired by meeting new people with different backgrounds.
