fun_facts:
  work: Industrial Engineer turned into Software Engineer, I'm a full stack dev that misses working with frontend when working too much with backend and vice versa. As a lot of my fellow engineering buddies, Capdesk is my first Ruby experience.
  other: Love to travel but almost got stuck in Portugal with a 1 year and a half kid in the beginning of the pandemic. Need to go back to properly explore the country (what I could see was already beautiful).
