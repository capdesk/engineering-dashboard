fun_facts:
  work: I have been part of building ZenEquity for India and looking forward to build some cool stuff for ESOPs globally. I love solving problems at work and at home (which sometimes becomes a bit annoying for others).
  other: I love music, playing guitar/keyboard, I love to sketch, play squash and badminton. So if someone shares these interests please ping me, I'm always up for a jam or a racket sport ðŸ™‚
