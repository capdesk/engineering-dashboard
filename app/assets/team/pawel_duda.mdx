fun_facts:
  work: Pascal was my first language ever used. PHP was my first language used in an actual job - but after a few years, I felt I needed to reconsider my life choices and started looking into Ruby. It was a great decision. Though, it doesnâ€™t beat the joy of using Elixir in my side projects :)
  other: My wake up alarm can be only turned off by scanning a NFC sticker in another room. For some reason, it still works for me after so many years. Whenever I sleep away from home, I forget about it and have to uninstall the app as the alarm goes off.
