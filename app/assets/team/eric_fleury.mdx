fun_facts:
  work: Been into web development since I was 12 but it took me years before deciding to make it a career. I even got in first as a psychology undergrad student before making the move into CS - never looked back!
  other: I have a tendency to be super intense in whatever my hobby of the moment is. For the past year I've been annoying everyone around me with board games - now I've just geared up for mountain biking and I'm currently resisting the urge to tell everyone how fun it is.
