fun_facts:
  work: I built a crypto wallet for cash economies in the Middle East. Before that I lived a few lives working at refugee camps, the United Nations, and the government. One day I automated my work with a cool lil web scraper and shared it with my homies. I never looked back.
  other: I hang out at (pull up) bars and listen to traditional instruments. Will make you spicy chai. Oh and BallisLife 🏀
