fun_facts:
  work: I now have a composer stand as a standup desk, and as a result I want to learn to code entirely using air gesture shortcuts, to complete the composer effect 🎼. However instead I’m simultaneously learning to use mac, and to use a german keyboard, so spend most of my time awkwardly trying unfamiliar keyboard shortcuts 🇩🇪🍏.
  other: I go bouldering as a hobby, and now that lockdowns are easing, I’m trying to get back in to it 🧗. I also take my dog along, but he’s a terrible climber 🐕🤷.
