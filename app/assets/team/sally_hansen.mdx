fun_facts:
  work: I am passionate about product and especially fond of the OKR framework as a way to ensure that you continue to deliver value and not just push features. The foundation for any good product decision is data IMO. I love Todoist and it basically runs my life.
  other: I can recite the multiples of 17. I have dual citizenship and it makes me feel like James Bond to have multiple passports.
