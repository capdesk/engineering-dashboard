fun_facts:
  work: I love designing experiences of all kinds. I'm pretty curious about the "why" of things, the way these work, the way these feel (you know ✨aesthetics✨- art school affected me way too much). So here I am, trying to create something that makes sense, looks cool, and is very easy to use.
  other: Made my own gin. Went on tour with a band. Got my work in an art gallery. Co-wrote some songs. Created a perfume with my friends. Did theatre. And not to brag, I usually stab a cherry tomato with my fork on the first try.
