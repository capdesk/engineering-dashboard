fun_facts:
  work: I try my best to make people's lives easier with code. Have had varying success in this endeavor. I've worked with Delphi, Scala, Go and Python. Capdesk is my first experience working with Ruby.
  other: Dislodged my right patella twice playing sports in my teens. It was more ugly than painful in my experience. I just love Monty Python, The IT Crowd, Rick and Morty and procedural art.
